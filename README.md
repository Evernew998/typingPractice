#### Description:
Typing Practice is a website developed using Python, Flask, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Its purpose is to allow people to practice their typing skills by typing a set number of random words. The website will then calculate their typing speed and accuracy. Currently, this website only supports two languages, English and Bahasa Malaysia. Also, it only supports the QWERTY keyboard layout. It requires the user to have a keyboard to work. So, it usually only works on desktops and laptops. 



I chose this project because I wanted to practice using Javascript. The biggest challenge I faced when developing this website was implementing the letter colour change feature. This feature changes the letter to green when the user types it correctly. Otherwise, it turns the letter red. Implementing this feature felt like I was trying to solve one of CS50's earlier problem sets. On the surface, the feature seemed simple. However, looking deeper into it, I discovered that there were more conditions that I needed to take into consideration. My biggest mistake was going straight into coding when trying to solve the new problems that kept popping up. Instead, even before doing anything, I should have taken the time to figure out exactly how I wanted to implement the feature.

Here is the procedure for using Typing Practice:
1. Choose a language to practice typing in by clicking on the language option tab at the top right-hand corner.
2. Select the total number of words to type in a single practice session by clicking on a number in the total number of words section at the bottom middle of the screen.
3. Type the random words that you see above the typing area. If you spell a letter correctly, the corresponding letter will turn green. If you spell it incorrectly, then it will turn red.
4. After you finish typing all the words, Typing Practice will calculate your gross words per minute, typing accuracy, and adjusted typing speed.

5. To reset everything, click the reset button in the middle of the screen or change the total number of words. The reset button will only appear after you have finished typing all the random words.
